## An end-to-end Machine Learning Project

Start the data ingestion by running the data_ingestion.py file. This will create the train, test and raw.csv. It will also start the data transformation, preprocess the data and train the model. 

Once the model is trained, we can go ahead and start our application. 
To start application, run the command python3 application.py to start the flask server. 
The site will run at localhost:5000/predictdata
